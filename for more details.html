               <h4><i>An art group is a collective of artists who come together to share their ideas, techniques, and artwork. They may work together 
                    on projects, hold exhibitions, or collaborate on other creative endeavors. Art groups can be found in many 
                    different forms, from informal gatherings of friends to more formal organizations with a specific mission or purpose. 
                    Some art groups focus on a particular medium or style, while others are more diverse and inclusive.
                     Art groups can be a great way for artists to connect with one another, learn new skills, and gain exposure for their work.</i></h4>
