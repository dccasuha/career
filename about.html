                <h3><p>        The term “art” is related to the Latin word “ars” meaning, art, skill, or craft.
                    The first known use of the word comes from 13th-century manuscripts. However, 
                    the word art and its many variants (artem, eart, etc.) have probably existed since the founding of Rome.</p>

                    <p><h3>Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or
                    imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.</h3></p>
                               <p><h3>There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly 
                    throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and
                    other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the arts.</p>
                    Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences.</h3></p>

                    <p><h3>In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished 
                    from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</h3></p>
                        <h3><p>   The performing arts are arts such as music, dance, and drama which are performed for an audience.[1] 
                    They are different from the visual arts, which are the use of paint, 
                    canvas or various materials to create physical or static art objects. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience, 
                    including theatre, music, and dance.</p></h3>
