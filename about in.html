                <h3><p> Science education is the teaching and learning of science to school children, college students, or adults within the general public. The field of 
                    science education includes work in science content, science process (the scientific method), some 
                    social science, and some teaching pedagogy.</p>

                    <p><h3>The standards for science education provide expectations
                        for the development of understanding for students through the entire course of their K-12 education and beyond.
                        The traditional subjects included in the standards are physical, life, earth, space, and human beings.</h3></p>
                               <p><h3>Elementary science should focus on simple natural phenomena (nature study) by means of experiments carried out "in-the-field."
                                Secondary science should focus on laboratory work and the committee's prepared lists of specific experiments
                                </h3></p>

                    <p><h3>Nature of Science education refers to the study of how science is a human initiative, how it interacts with society, what scientists do,
                         how scientific knowledge is built up and exchanged, how it evolves, how it is used. It stresses the empirical nature and the different methods 
                         used in science. The goals of Nature of Science education are stated to be to help students evaluate scientific and 
                         pseudo scientific statements, to motivate them to study science and to better prepare them for a career in science or
                          in a field that interacts with science.[19]
